# QR-Code-Encryption

This python script was developed as a part to the project for the IGEM (international Genetic Enegineered Machines) competition by team Groningen 2019.

The goal of the script is to develop QR codes with AES encrypted messages and be able to decrypt them.

Encryption of a message will output a 3D version of the QR code to be 3D printed, or in PNG format.

Extruded version is achieved by extruding the png version using the numpy2stl script
